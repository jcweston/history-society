            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Chebsey Parish Local History Society was set up in 2018 to create a lasting archive of photographs capturing the history of people and places in the parish of Chebsey and to make these available to the local community through a series of exhibitions and booklets. By doing this we want to discover the history of our parish and tell its story and to develop a local history resource.  The area we cover is Chebsey Parish which includes Shallowford, Hilcote, Heammies, Cold Norton, Norton Bridge and Chebsey.</p>
            <p>In addition, we currently have a Heritage Lottery Grant for our project ‘WW1 and Beyond’ to research the history and impact of war on a rural parish. </p>
            <h3>How You Can Help</h3>
            <p>We want to involve as many people as possible so that the group’s activities and the history that is captured are as inclusive as possible.  Therefore, we need your ideas, your memories, your photos and documents.   For example, if you have any historical photographs/postcards/newspaper clippings/ old family/school photos or stories passed down, then we’d love to hear from you  In fact any information or pictures relating to the parish; we’d love to scan or record them to incorporate them in the project.</p>
            <h3>Where We Meet</h3>
            <p>If you’re interested in finding out more,  please feel free to drop in to one of our meetings which are held weekly 9.30 to 10.30 every Thursday morning at St. Luke’s Church, Norton Bridge before the weekly community drop-in.</p>
